# 📦 Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework Implementation

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing a full-scale Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework for a manufacturing company struggling with fragmented, outdated, and reactive risk management practices. The organization faces complex operational challenges: supply chain disruptions, evolving cyber threats, and regulatory pressures in quality control.

The goal was to create a centralized, strategic ERM framework to align with the company’s objectives, enforce governance, and ensure resilience.

## 📝 Deliverable 1: Current Risk Management Maturity Assessment & Gap Analysis

### 🔍 Observations

- The company’s current risk management is **reactive** and **disconnected across departments**.
- Cybersecurity efforts are **not keeping pace** with evolving threats.
- **Quality controls are inadequate**, and compliance with modern regulatory frameworks is lacking.
- **Supply chain disruptions** are actively impacting production.

### ⚠️ Identified Gaps

1. **Data Integrity Issues**  
   - In the supply chain, poor data practices risk customer/wholesaler data exposure.
2. **Inability to Adapt to Cyber Threats**  
   - Teams show low awareness of evolving regulations and lack a proactive approach.
3. **No Centralized Risk Management Hub**  
   - Logs and risk data are siloed (e.g., separate logs in accounting, IT, and sales), making auditability and risk oversight impossible.
4. **Missing Internal Audit Function**  
   - No role is assigned to track regulatory changes, monitor compliance, or test controls.

## 🧩 Deliverable 2: ERM Framework Design & Risk Appetite Statement

### 🎯 Risk Appetite Statement

The company accepts the **risk associated with proactive auditing**, showing low tolerance for unverified risks. Regular audits are not seen as burdens but as essential tools for resilience and trust.

### 👥 Stakeholders Involved

- CEO, CFO, CTO, CISO, COO
- Compliance Officer, GRC Analysts
- HR, Internal Audit, and Operational Teams

### 🏗️ ERM Framework Components

- Internal audits scheduled regularly to detect risk early
- Solutions developed based on gaps uncovered
- Adherence to security policies emphasized across departments
- Clear documentation and communication of risks and resolutions

### ⚖️ Risk Classification Criteria

- Systems connected to **critical infrastructure** are marked as **high impact, high likelihood**.
- Example: A **supply chain disruption** qualifies as both high-likelihood and high-impact and must be logged in the **central risk register**.

### 🔁 Roles & Responsibilities

- **Internal Auditor** – Ensures ongoing compliance and tracks regulatory updates
- **IT Team** – Secures internal systems and handles incident response
- **Sales Team** – Oversees supplier relationships and flags vendor risk
- **HR Team** – Owns and enforces security and compliance policies
- **Incident Response Team** – Coordinates technical and procedural responses

## 📋 Deliverable 3: Risk Register & Treatment Plan

### 🗂️ Risk Register Structure

Each risk includes:
- Asset or system at risk
- Risk type and description
- Risk owner
- Likelihood and impact
- Estimated resolution time
- Chosen treatment strategy

### 🔍 Example Risk: Supplier Non-Compliance with GDPR

- **Category:** Operational / Regulatory  
- **Description:** Supplier may be tracking customer data in violation of GDPR.  
- **Owner:** Sales + HR  
- **Likelihood/Impact:** High  
- **Resolution Timeframe:** 3–4 months  

### 🧪 Treatment Plan

- **Meet with Supplier** to discuss risk and collect evidence of data handling practices.
- **TPRM Implementation:**
  - Third-party compliance checks
  - Accreditation and breach history (minimum 5 years)
  - Contractual obligations for data protection
- **Final Decision:**  
  - If supplier aligns with organizational values and proves compliance, they are retained.  
  - If not, the relationship is discontinued — **risk avoidance**.

### 🛡️ Risk Treatment Strategies

- **Mitigation:** Enforce security policies, third-party checks, and controls.
- **Acceptance:** Accept the remaining risk if residual risk is within appetite.
- **Transfer:** Shift risk via contractual clauses or insurance.
- **Avoidance:** Cut ties with suppliers who don't meet standards.

## 🧭 Deliverable 4: Governance, Metrics, and Continuous Improvement

### 🧑‍💼 Governance Structure

- **Risk Management Committee** (RMC) led by executive leadership
- Oversees the risk register, enforces frameworks, monitors stakeholders
- Ensures **ongoing alignment** between operations, policy, and risk posture

### 📊 Metrics & KPIs

- Reduction in **supply chain disruptions**
- Reduced **employee misunderstanding of cyber risks**
- Comparative performance over past 6 months, measured via follow-up audits

### 📈 KRIs (Key Risk Indicators)

- Track **emerging risks**
- Confirm that mitigation strategies are effective
- Ensure risks logged are being addressed and reduced

### 🧩 Reporting & Communication

- Reports translated into both technical and non-technical formats
- Visuals used: **graphs, charts, status dashboards**
- Internal audit reports delivered every 3 months to stakeholders

### 🔁 Continuous Improvement

- The RMC meets quarterly to evaluate the framework’s effectiveness.
- Adjustments made based on evolving threats, audit feedback, and organizational changes.
- The ERM system is dynamic — built to adapt and evolve.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This project highlights how a company can move from **reactive risk management** to a **mature, centralized ERM strategy**. With proper governance, ownership, and structured monitoring, risk becomes a manageable, measurable business enabler — not just a threat.
