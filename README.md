# Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework Implementation

## Project Overview

A well-established manufacturing company is facing increased operational complexity: supply chain disruptions, cybersecurity threats, and quality control requirements. Their risk practices are fragmented and reactive. This project implements a tailored Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework to address these gaps and improve resilience.

## Deliverables

### 1. Risk Management Maturity Assessment & Gap Analysis
- Identified a reactive, outdated risk posture.
- Noted major gaps: data integrity issues, lack of centralized risk platform, and missing internal audit function.

### 2. ERM Framework & Risk Appetite Statement
- Risk appetite defined as low tolerance for unverified risks and strong support for regular audits.
- Stakeholders include leadership and operational heads (CEO, CFO, CISO, HR, etc.).
- Proposed a regular audit cycle, with risk categorization based on impact and likelihood.

### 3. Risk Register & Risk Treatment Plan
- Risk register fields: asset, type, owner, description, likelihood, impact, treatment time.
- Example: GDPR compliance risk from suppliers; treated through vendor audits and Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM).
- Treatment strategies: mitigate, accept, transfer, avoid.

### 4. ERM Governance, Metrics & Continuous Improvement
- Governance led by a Risk Management Committee.
- KPIs include reduction in supply chain disruption and increased cyber awareness.
- Continuous audits and reports to ensure effectiveness and stakeholder visibility.
